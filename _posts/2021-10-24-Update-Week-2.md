Hello All, time for the weekly update.
This week the git org was created (still no main repo) and the branding etc was added. 
Naamloos has looked into Sodium and what it uses to render, according to ZNix Sodium's OpenGL calls are simple enough to port to a different renderer, what I plan to do. Naamloos had some conversation with artDev about why gl4es isn't working for the newer minecraft versions, This was caused by shaders. Naamloos is not entirely sure what kind of issues we might run into because of this, but that is something we'll stumble upon sooner or later.
Other than that not much development has happened this week (as can happen with projects). But don't be deterred, this is normal in an opensource project as developers are not working full time on this project.

Best regards,
QC Development Team
